Task 1

Currency Converter

Design

For this task I needed to split the code into three different parts. These parts were:

1) The system should be able to have exchange rates changed when necessary by the user.

2) The user must input the amount they want to convert, the currency they are converting from and the currency they are converting to.

3) The output must be put to two decimal places (eg. £1.09)

I also need to make sure that the input is a number, and an error message must be displayed if the input is invalid.

Pseudo code

It will ask for what abbreviated curremcy code for the currency you want to convert from.
They will be: GBP, EUR, USD, JPY
GBP being Pounds Sterling(£), EUR is Euros(€), USD is US Dollars($), JPY is Japanese Yen(¥).
After that it then asks what currency you want to convert to.
It will use the same system before, currency codes.
It will then multiply the input by the currency rate.
It then prints out the result.
The answer is the value of the two numbers you just multiplyed.
This is my plan to make task one work.

Attempt 1 (FAILED)

This was the first code for the convert

if choice == rates[0]:
   entry= input("You have selected Pounds. Now please enter a sum of money:")
   answer = (entry*rates[0])
   print(answer)

if choice == rates[1]:
   entry= input("You have selected Dollar. Now please enter a sum of money:")
   answer = (entry*rates[1])
   print(answer)

if choice == rates[2]:
   entry= input("You have selected Yen. Now please enter a sum of money:")
   answer = (entry*rates[2])
   print(answer)

if choice == rates[3]:
   entry= input("You have selected Euro. Now please enter a sum of money:")
   answer = (entry*rates[3])
   print(answer)

#setup the decimal data type (including number of decimal places)
import decimal

#get the current value and type from the user
currencyAmount = decimal.Decimal(raw_input('please enter the amount: '))
currencyType = int(raw_input('please enter the type or if you want to change the rates (1 = pound, 2 = euro, 3 = dollar, 4 = yen): '))

#set the exchange rates (based on sterling)
euro = decimal.Decimal('1.2')
dollar = decimal.Decimal('1.6')
yen = decimal.Decimal('200')
#This will multiply the 2 numbers that you want to convert 

#convert the currency into pound sterling
if (currencyType == 2):
    currencyAmount = currencyAmount / euro
elif (currencyType == 3):
    currencyAmount = currencyAmount / dollar
elif (currencyType == 4):
    currencyAmount = currencyAmount / yen
#Tells the computer if a number 1 to 4 is picked it will run ethier pound, euro, yen or dollars 

#ask the user what currency they want it converted into
currencyConvert = int(raw_input('please enter the currency you would like to convert to (1 = pound, 2 = euro, 3 = dollar, 4 = yen): '))
#it then takes the numbers 1 to 4 and runs what the number is linked to.
#convert the currency into the new format (pound already done in previous steps)
if (currencyConvert == 2):
    currencyAmount = currencyAmount * euro
elif (currencyConvert == 3):
    currencyAmount = currencyAmount * dollar
elif (currencyConvert == 4):
    currencyAmount = currencyAmount * yen

#show the amount of money converted to user
print 'the result of the currency conversion was ',  currencyAmount.quantize(decimal.Decimal('0.00'))
Task 1 was one of the hardest tasks partly because of trying to convert to numbers. It took a while but i finaly got it. After that it was easy. Just put some words to print to the user to make it look pretty.

Task 1 PASSED

Task 2

Address book

A surname and first name
Two lines of the address and the post code
A telephone number
Date of birth
Email address
Search with:

By surname to retrieve and display the details for a contact
By the date of birth to retrieve and display all contacts with a birthday in a particular month
Pseudo code

Welcome the user to the address book     
The address book will then ask the user to input two number to select if they want to add or search for an address
If the user clicks 1 they will be taken to the address adder
It will ask them to make an address based of their:
First name
Last name
Telephone
Email 
Address
Once this process is done it will add it to the address book to be search for at a later date
If the user pressed 2 then it will take them to the search engine
It will ask the user if they want to search by surname or by date of birth
If 1 is pressed it will ask the user to input a surname
The user will input a surname and the computer will find anyone in the address book with that surname
It will then print to the user all of the people with that surname
If 2 is pressed then it will search with the date of birth
The user must input the numbers 01 to 12
The numbers the user has input to the computer will then be used to search for the date of birth
The computer will then print all of the contacts with the same date

It was a pain trying to transfer to contacts at first but once i found out to import the datafile it was fine
Up to a point were the search line is.
The search part of the code was one of the worst to overcome.
I think it was because i was over thinking it.
But now its fixed and task 2 is complete
Task 2 PASSED

Task 3

ISBN

The number entered must be correct length
Only contains the digits 0 to 9
Pseudo code

Asks the user to input two numbers
If 2 pressed the programme is ended
If 1 is pressed the code goes on
It asks the to input a 10 digit number
If the digit number is not 10 it then loops to enter a 10 digit number
Once the user has input a 10 digit number the maths side of the code works out the number
The end result it the output to the user
Task 3 (PASSED)

#Tells the user to choose between starting or ending the programme
decision = str(input(""" What would you like to do?; 
1) Convert a 10 digit number to an ISBN number(1) 
2) Quit and end the programme(2)""")) 

#Ends the programme

    quit()
    print("Good Bye!") 

#Asks the user to input a 10 digit number

The hardest part of the code was the maths part but nothing else was that bad.
It was pretty easy.
